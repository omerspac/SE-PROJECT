# 🎓 AI University FAQ Support Chatbot (Pakistan)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI University FAQ Support Chatbot** is a Software Engineering academic project designed to assist students in Pakistan who are confused about university choices after Intermediate or Graduation.

The chatbot acts as a **friendly university advisor**, guiding students in selecting suitable degree programs and universities based on their:
- Academic background
- Interests
- Budget
- City preferences

The system focuses **only on Pakistani universities** and provides clear, human-like guidance instead of robotic or system-based responses.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Application
Many students in Pakistan struggle with:
- Choosing the right degree after Intermediate
- Deciding between public vs private universities
- Understanding career prospects of different programs
- Lack of proper academic counseling

This chatbot was created to:
- Provide **accessible academic guidance**
- Simulate a **human university advisor**
- Reduce confusion among students
- Demonstrate practical use of **AI in education**

The application avoids giving exact admission dates or test details and instead focuses on **direction, clarity, and decision-making support**.

## 🤖 What the Chatbot Can Do
- Recommend suitable programs (BBA, CS, Engineering, MBA, MS, etc.)
- Suggest Pakistani universities based on student profile
- Compare public and private universities
- Discuss affordability and career prospects
- Ask gentle follow-up questions to better guide students
- Maintain a **natural and conversational tone**

---

## 🚫 What the Chatbot Does NOT Do
- It does not discuss non-Pakistani universities
- It does not provide exact admission dates or entry test schedules
- It does not say “do your own research”
- It does not transfer users to other agents or systems

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **Chainlit** (Frontend UI)
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**
- **OpenRouter API**
- **Async Programming (asyncio)**

---

## 🧩 System Design (High Level)
- Single intelligent advisor agent
- Context engineering used to control tone, behavior, and scope
- Conversation history maintained for continuity
- Designed to feel human, supportive, and helpful
